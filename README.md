## ‚öôÔ∏è Middlewares Used

Middlewares are used for tasks like request validation, session handling, error management, and more:

* Auth protection
* Error handling
* JSON body parsing
* Token validation
* File upload handling (via Multer)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Media Handling (Cloudinary + Multer)

* **Cloudinary** is used for uploading and storing user media (profile pictures, thumbnails, videos).
* **Multer** works alongside Cloudinary to handle incoming files in forms and API calls.

---

## üîê Auth with JWT

JWTs are used to create secure access and refresh tokens, allowing users to maintain sessions across devices. Each token carries user information securely and expires after a defined time for added protection.

---

## ‚ú® Development Tools

* **Prettier** ensures consistent code formatting.
* **Dotenv** simplifies environment management across development and production.
* **Bcrypt** strengthens password storage through secure hashing.
